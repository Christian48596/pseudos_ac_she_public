# MG CHANGELOG

Ac: Add 1 projector for f to improve logder.

Th_5f.in: Decrease rc for d by 0.5
          NB: This pseudos uses a sligly excited configuration with fractional occupancies.

Pa_5f.in: Optimize qcut, now ecut ~58

U_5f.in: Optimize qcut, decrease core radii, now ecut ~58, previously it was ~68

Np_5f.in: Optimize qcut, decrease core radii, now ecut ~58, previously it was ~62

Pu_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.1, no change in qcut values. 
          Already very good and similar to Np_5f.in
 
Am_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2, no change in qcut values. ecut ~70

Cm_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2, minor adjustments in qcut values. ecut ~70

Bk_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2. No change in qcut values. ecut ~72

CF_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2. Important optimization of qcut values: from ~105 to ~72

Es_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2. No change in qcut values. ecut ~75

Fm_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~73

Md_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~75

No_5f.in: decrease rc for d by 0.2. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~78

Lr_5f.in: decrease rc for p by 0.2, d by 0.05. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~95 due to rc 1.2 for 5f.
          BTW: twpo possible configurations: [Rn]5f147s27p1 or 5f146d17s2

Rf: decrease rc for p and d. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~95, previous ~105
Fb: decrease rc for p and d. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~96, previous ~105
Sg: decrease rc for p and d. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~98, previous ~108
Bh: decrease rc for p and d. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~100, previous ~108
Hs: decrease rc for p and d. Minor adjustment in qcut values. ecut ~102, previous ~108
